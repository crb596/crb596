# Money: The Movie
## 30MFF WEB SITE
## Site by Cole Beasley

For this site I wanted to go for a look sort of like how Netflix does their movie pages. I also decided to try and keep everything on one page with an animation and menu bar to help users know where they are at like a lot of sites are now doing. I have never tried this approach before but overally I am happy with the results and I think the site as a whole is very fitting for our film. 

The site is broken down into five main pages: the landing page where there is a short description and the title, as well as a background image of money I made, second the film itself for users to watch on the site, third I have all the actor information, fourth some reviews of our fantastic film, all written by me, and finally information about the possible upcoming sequel to our film
